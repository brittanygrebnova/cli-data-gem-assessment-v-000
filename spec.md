# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application (My lib/jersey_family_fun/cli.rb file contains methods for greeting the user, listing the daily events, and accepting input to return a chosen event.)
- [x] Pull data from an external source (My lib/jersey_family_fun/event.rb file contains the scrape_events method that scrapes www.njkidsonline.com and creates instances of events and assigns attributes to each instance.)
- [x] Implement both list and detail views (When the CLI is started, it provides a list of daily events, then the user can choose an event to see just that event's info.)
